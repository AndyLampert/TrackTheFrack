Track the Frack
=============
## Overview  
There is a little to no usable neighborhood scale data of water quality concerns in Boulder County. A resident wants to document her concerns about the effects of hydraulic fracturing on her water well quality and compare her results against neighbors' reports. 

## Installation, Usage  
Todo  

## Contributing  
Here are some ways you can contribute:
* by reporting bugs
* by suggesting new features
* by writing or editing documentation
* by writing specifications
* by writing code (no patch is too small: fix typos, add comments, clean up inconsistent whitespace)
* by refactoring code
* by closing issues
